# JS-Django_music-player
Using Django to develop a database for a music player built with JS. This will teach and also increase my experience in working with JS using Python frameworks.
This music player is a joint project between @AlphaCodz and @YeeshaDev. You are free to contribute to the project and modify it in your own way. 
Happy Learning!
